- **Data Access**: Databases enable authorized users and applications to access data quickly and securely.

## Importance of Databases

- **Data Management**: Databases help manage large volumes of data effectively.
- **Decision-Making**: Properly organized data can lead to better insights and decision-making.
- **Automation**: Databases allow automated storage and retrieval processes, saving time and reducing human error.
