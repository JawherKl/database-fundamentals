# Components of a Database

Databases are made up of several essential components, each serving a specific function.

## Key Database Components

1. **Tables**: Organize data into rows and columns.
2. **Indexes**: Speed up data retrieval by creating references for specific columns.
3. **Schemas**: Define the structure of the database, including table and column organization.
4. **Views**: Virtual tables that provide a specific perspective of data, often used for security.

## Purpose of Each Component

- **Tables** store structured data.
- **Indexes** enhance query performance.
- **Schemas** ensure data integrity and structure.
- **Views** help in data abstraction and security.
