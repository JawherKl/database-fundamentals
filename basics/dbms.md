# Database Management Systems (DBMS)

A **Database Management System (DBMS)** is software that interacts with the database, applications, and users to capture and analyze data. It controls data organization, storage, and retrieval, ensuring efficient and secure data management.

## Key Components of a DBMS

1. **Database Engine**: Core service for data processing.
2. **Database Schema**: Defines the structure of data.
3. **Query Processor**: Interprets and executes data queries.
4. **Access Control**: Manages permissions and data security.

## Types of DBMS

- **Relational DBMS (RDBMS)**: Uses structured tables and SQL.
- **NoSQL DBMS**: Supports flexible schema, often document-based or key-value.
- **In-Memory DBMS**: Stores data in RAM for fast access.
