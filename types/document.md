# Document Database

**Document Databases** store data as documents, typically in JSON, BSON, or XML formats. These databases are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data, making them flexible and ideal for hierarchical data.

## Key Characteristics

- **Schema Flexibility**: No fixed schema, allowing documents to have varying fields and structures.
- **Embedded Data**: Related data can be stored within the same document, reducing the need for complex joins.
- **Hierarchical Data Structure**: Ideal for storing nested data, which can represent real-world hierarchical relationships.

## Advantages

1. **Scalability**: Easily scalable horizontally by sharding data across multiple nodes.
2. **Flexibility**: Can handle various document structures, adapting to different data requirements.
3. **High Performance for Reads/Writes**: Efficient for read-heavy and write-heavy workloads, especially for JSON-like data.

## Use Cases

- **Content Management Systems (CMS)**: Storing articles, comments, and other document-based content.
- **E-commerce Applications**: Product catalogs with diverse attribute sets across different categories.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Handling semi-structured data for rapid ingestion and query performance.

Document databases are commonly used in scenarios requiring flexible schemas and efficient handling of nested data.
