# Types of Databases

This section provides an overview of different database types, covering their characteristics, uses, and unique features. Hereâ€™s what each file explores:

- **SQL Databases**: Traditional relational databases that use structured schemas and support ACID transactions.
- **NoSQL Databases**: A broad category of databases that provide flexibility in data storage, including types like document, key-value, graph, and wide-column stores.
- **Document Databases**: NoSQL databases that store data as JSON-like documents, making them ideal for unstructured data.
- **Key-Value Databases**: Simple databases that store data as key-value pairs, useful for high-performance, quick lookups.
- **Graph Databases**: Specialized databases for handling data with complex relationships, using nodes and edges to model connections.
- **Wide-Column Databases**: NoSQL databases that store data in columns rather than rows, often used for analytics and big data.
