# Database Latency

**Latency** is the delay between a request and the response from the database.

## Factors Affecting Latency

1. **Network Delays**: Time taken for data to travel over the network.
2. **Disk I/O**: Speed of read/write operations.
3. **Database Load**: High volume of requests or complex queries.

## Techniques to Reduce Latency

- **Indexing**: Speeds up data retrieval.
- **Caching**: Stores frequently accessed data for faster access.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes requests across multiple servers.
