# Database Challenges

This section delves into the common challenges encountered in database management, especially as data systems grow and become more complex:

- **Scaling**: Understanding the complexities of scaling databases for increased data volume and read/write loads.
- **Security**: Exploring the various security challenges, including access control, data encryption, and compliance.
- **Latency**: Examining how latency impacts database performance and the techniques used to mitigate it.

Each file provides a detailed exploration of these challenges and presents solutions or best practices commonly applied in database management.
