# Database Scaling

**Scaling** a database means increasing its capacity to handle more data or traffic.

## Types of Scaling

1. **Vertical Scaling**: Adding resources (CPU, RAM) to a single server.
2. **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more servers or instances to distribute the load.
3. **Sharding**: Splitting data across multiple databases or instances.

## Challenges in Scaling

- **Data Consistency**: Ensuring all servers have up-to-date information.
- **Latency**: Minimizing delays in data retrieval.
- **Cost**: Scaling requires significant resources and infrastructure investment.
